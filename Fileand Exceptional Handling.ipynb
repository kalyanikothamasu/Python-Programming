Using `newline=''` when opening the file in write mode is crucial to avoid extra blank rows.\n","*   `csv.DictReader` reads each row into an ordered dictionary, using the first row as keys by default.\n","*   `csv.DictWriter` writes data from a list of dictionaries to a CSV file, requiring `fieldnames` to define the header and key order. `writeheader()` writes the header row.\n","*   CSV dialects allow handling variations in CSV formats (delimiters, quote characters, etc.). Custom dialects can be registered using `csv.register_dialect()` and listed using `csv.list_dialects()`.\n","*   The `fieldnames` parameter in `DictReader`/`DictWriter` explicitly defines the header/keys.\n","*   Parameters like `delimiter`, `quotechar`, and `quoting` control how fields are separated, quoted, and when quoting occurs during reading and writing. `quoting` constants (`csv.QUOTE_ALL`, `csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL`, `csv.QUOTE_NONE`, `csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC`) offer different behaviors.\n","*   The `skipinitialspace` parameter, when set to `True`, ignores spaces immediately following the delimiter when reading.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","*   When working with CSV files that deviate from the standard comma-separated format, defining and using custom dialects or explicitly specifying `delimiter` and `quotechar` parameters is essential for correct parsing.\n","*   Choosing between `reader`/`writer` and `DictReader`/`DictWriter` depends on whether you prefer to access data by index (list) or by header name (dictionary). `DictReader`/`DictWriter` is generally more robust when dealing with potential column order changes if the header is consistent.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"8822962d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754462200062,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":33,"user":{"displayName":"Kalyani Kmas","userId":"17646635431045589522"}},"outputId":"420b007b-0b99-4134-8c49-4626e9062e3d"},"source":["data_to_write = [\n","    {'Name': 'Alice', 'Age': 30, 'City': 'New York'},\n","    {'Name': 'Bob', 'Age': 25, 'City': 'London'},\n","    {'Name': 'Charlie', 'Age': 35, 'City': 'Paris'}\n","]\n","\n","# Convert the list of dictionaries to a single dictionary using 'Name' as the key\n","converted_data = {item['Name']: item for item in data_to_write}\n","\n","print(converted_data.keys())"],"execution_count":47,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["dict_keys(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'])\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Example: Converting a list of key-value pairs to a dictionary\n","list_of_pairs = [('name', 'Alice'), ('age', 30), ('city', 'New York')]\n","dictionary_from_list = dict(list_of_pairs)\n","print(\"Dictionary created from list:\", dictionary_from_list)\n","\n","# Example: Getting keys (headers) from a dictionary\n","dictionary_data = {'ID': 1, 'Name': 'Bob', 'Occupation': 'Artist'}\n","headers_from_dict = list(dictionary_data.keys()) # Convert keys view to a list\n","print(\"Headers from dictionary:\", headers_from_dict)\n","\n","# Example: Getting headers from a list (assuming the first item is the header row)\n","list_data_with_header = [\n","    ['Header1', 'Header2', 'Header3'],\n","    ['Value1', 'Value2', 'Value3']\n","]\n","headers_from_list = list_data_with_header[0]\n","print(\"Headers from list:\", headers_from_list)\n","\n","# Example: Getting keys from the dictionary data_to_write from the previous cell (these are keys of each inner dictionary)\n","print(\"Keys from dictionaries in data_to_write:\", list(data_to_write[0].keys()))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"o_g1-7pzGSK-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754462275943,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":71,"user":{"displayName":"Kalyani Kmas","userId":"17646635431045589522"}},"outputId":"636f1e68-ead7-4b35-c1c2-fedd31cf115d"},"execution_count":48,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Dictionary created from list: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n","Headers from dictionary: ['ID', 'Name', 'Occupation']\n","Headers from list: ['Header1', 'Header2', 'Header3']\n","Keys from dictionaries in data_to_write: ['Name', 'Age', 'City']\n"]}]}]}
